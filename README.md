DATA CLEANING PROJECT
-------------------------

Project Overview

This Data Cleaning Project is designed to enhance the quality of a dataset by performing various cleaning operations. The project focuses on removing duplicate records, standardizing data formats, addressing null or blank values, and removing irrelevant or unnecessary columns. I used MySQL and MySQL Workbench to execute SQL scripts that automate these tasks, ensuring my dataset is optimized for further analysis or operational use.

PREREQUISITES:

To run the SQL scripts included in this project, you will need:

MySQL Server 
MySQL Workbench
Ensure that both are properly installed and configured on your system.
